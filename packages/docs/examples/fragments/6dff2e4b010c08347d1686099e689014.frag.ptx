  <statement>
    <p>
      Polynomials of degree 3 do not form a vector space.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>
      The set is not closed under addition and lacks an additive identity.
    </p>
  </answer>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The sum of elements <m>x^3 + x^2</m> and <m>-x^3 + x</m> equals
      <m>x^2 + x</m> which is not of degree 3,
      so the set is not closed under vector addition.
    </p>
  </solution>
  <solution>
    <p>
      We can also note that the zero polynomial does not have degree 3,
      so is not an element of the set.
    </p>
  </solution>
