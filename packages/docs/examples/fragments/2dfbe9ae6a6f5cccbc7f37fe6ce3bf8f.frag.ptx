    <title>Pivot columns</title>
    <p>
        When we consider a linear system of the form <m>Ax=b</m>,
        we know (via Gaussian elimination) that the system is solvable if
        and only if the rightmost column of the augmented matrix <m>[A|b]</m>
        is not a pivot column, which is to say that the reduced
        row-echelon form of the augmented matrix does not have a row of the form
        <m>[0\ 0 \dots 0\ *]</m> where <m>*</m> is a nonzero scalar.
