    <p> Many positive integers can be represented as the sum of three
      integer cubes: <m>n =
      x^3 + y^3 +z^3.</m> Exactly one of <m>n = 12, 13</m> can be
        represented as the sum of three cubes. Determine a representation
        for the one that can, and a reason for the one that cannot. </p>

    <hint>
      <p> For the one that is representable, the absolute values of
        <m>x,y,z</m> are all less than 12. </p>
    </hint>
    <hint>
      <p>
        For the one that is not representable, consider the values of
          cubes modulo 9.
