    <title>Optional</title>
    <p>
        For an arbitrary group <m>G</m>, we typically denote the operations
        multiplicatively, so for elements <m>a,b \in G</m>, we would write
        <m>a\cdot b</m> or <m>a^{-1}</m> for the the application of the group
        operation or the inverse of an element.  However, when a group is known
        to be abelian, the notation is often written additively,
        such as <m>a+b</m> or <m>-a</m>.
