       <stanza>
           <line>Some say the world will end in fire,</line>
           <line>Some say in ice.</line>
           <line>From what I've tasted of desire</line>
           <line>I hold with those who favor fire.</line>
           <line>But if it had to perish twice,</line>
           <line>I think I know enough of hate</line>
           <line>To say that for destruction ice</line>
           <line>Is also great</line>
           <line>And would suffice.</line>
