    <title>Eigenvectors and kernels</title>
    <p>
    Given a linear map <m>T:V \to V</m> on a vector space <m>V</m> over a field
    <m>F</m>, an eigenvalue is a scalar <m>\lambda\in F</m> for which there exists
    a nonzero vector <m>v\in V</m> (an eigenvector) for which
    <m>T(v) = \lambda v</m>. At first blush this may seem an odd notion,
    but it becomes less so when we observe that eigenvalues are defined to be those
    scalars <m>\lambda\in F</m> for which <m>\ker(T-\lambda I_V) \ne 0.</m>
