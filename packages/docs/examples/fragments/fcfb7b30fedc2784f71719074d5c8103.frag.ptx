   <statement>
     <p>
       Let <m>P_n(\mathbb R)</m> denote the real vector space of polynomials
       of degree at most <m>n</m>.
       The map <m>T:P_n(\mathbb R) \to P_n(\mathbb R)</m> given by
       <m>T(p) = p'</m>, taking a polynomial to its derivative,
       is a linear map.
     </p>
   </statement>
   <hint>
     <p>
       What do you know about how the derivative affects the degree
       of a polynomial and what did you learn in calculus about the
       derivative of a sum of differentiable functions?
     </p>

   <hint>
     <p>
       How about the derivative of a constant times a differentiable function?
