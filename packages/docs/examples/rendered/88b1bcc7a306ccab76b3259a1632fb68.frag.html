    In almost any algebraic context, you should never try to a define a map
    directly whose domain is a quotient, rather try to find a natural way to
    invoke the first isomorphism theorem.

    For example if <span class="process-math">\(V,W\)</span> are vector spaces
    and <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is a subspace of
    <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> rather than try to define a
    map <span class="process-math">\(T:V/U \to W\text{,}\)</span> try instead to
    define a map <span class="process-math">\(T_0:V\to W\)</span> whose kernel
    is <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and image is the same as that of
    <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> It is easier than you think
    and always well-defined.
