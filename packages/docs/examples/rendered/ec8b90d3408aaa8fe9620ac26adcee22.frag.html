    For an arbitrary group <span class="process-math">\(G\text{,}\)</span> we
    typically denote the operations multiplicatively, so for elements
    <span class="process-math">\(a,b \in G\text{,}\)</span> we would write
    <span class="process-math">\(a\cdot b\)</span> or
    <span class="process-math">\(a^{-1}\)</span> for the the application of the
    group operation or the inverse of an element. However, when a group is known
    to be abelian, the notation is often written additively, such as
    <span class="process-math">\(a+b\)</span> or
    <span class="process-math">\(-a\text{.}\)</span>
