    <div class="line left">Some say the world will end in fire,</div>
    <div class="line left">Some say in ice.</div>
    <div class="line left">From what Iâ€™ve tasted of desire</div>
    <div class="line left">I hold with those who favor fire.</div>
    <div class="line left">But if it had to perish twice,</div>
    <div class="line left">I think I know enough of hate</div>
    <div class="line left">To say that for destruction ice</div>
    <div class="line left">Is also great</div>
    <div class="line left">And would suffice.</div>
