# `<paragraphs>`

The `<paragraphs>` tag is a pseudo-division. It is a way of grouping material together 
that doesn't get a number, but it can have a title and be the subject of a cross-reference 
with custom text.  `<paragraphs>` might be used if an author doesn't want to fully 
partition a section into subsections but still wants to spend some extended time on a particular 
topic. An author might also use `<paragraphs>` for exposition containing one or more 
interactive questions, since an `<exercise>` cannot be a child of an `<example>`, but it can be 
a child of `<paragraphs>`.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="paragraphs" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT>
    <paragraphs><title>A set of material an author wants to group together</title>
        <p>
            An author can put lots of different elements inside the paragraphs
            pseudo-division, including tables, images, exercises, etc.
        </p>
        <exercise>
            <p>
                This exercise could be interactive to keep the readers' attention in the 
                middle of exposition of a topic.
            </p>
        </exercise>
        <p>
            An author could say more here.  The paragraphs tag can be cross-referenced
            and linked to from elsewhere within the document.
        </p>
    </paragraphs>
</FRAGMENT>
