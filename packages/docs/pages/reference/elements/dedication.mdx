# `<dedication>`

The `<dedication>` tag is an optional element of [`<frontmatter>`](./frontmatter) containing
a small amount of text about who or what the project is dedicated to.  It 
becomes its own division, whose name can be changed by giving it a `<title>`.  It is related to,
but distinct from, [`<acknowledgement>`](./acknowledgement) and [`<contributors>`](./contributors).

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="dedication" />
