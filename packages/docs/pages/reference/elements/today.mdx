# `<today>`

The self-closing `<today/>` tag outputs the date that the PreTeXt content was compiled (or re-compiled). Its content
will change on every compilation, so take care if you are trying to produce archivable documents.

## Syntax

<SyntaxDisplay name="today" />

## Examples

```ptx-example
<FRAGMENT parents="p">
    This example was written on <today/>.
</FRAGMENT>
```
